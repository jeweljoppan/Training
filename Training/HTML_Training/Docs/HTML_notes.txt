Float property
The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.
The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.
Float:
left - The element floats to the left of its container
right- The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
Clear:
none - Allows floating elements on both sides. This is default
left - No floating elements allowed on the left side
right- No floating elements allowed on the right side
both - No floating elements allowed on either the left or the right side
inherit - The element inherits the clear value of its parent
If an element is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, it will "overflow" outside of its container:Then we can add overflow: auto; to the containing element to fix this problem:
